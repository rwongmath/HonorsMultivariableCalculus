\chapter{Preface}
These lecture notes are written for Math 32A/BH, the honors multivariable calculus sequence at UCLA.  Multivariable calculus is the mathematical language that allows us to describe the geometry of the physical world around us, such as the motion of planets in orbit, the behavior of electromagnetic forces, or the path of steepest ascent through the hills of Los Angeles. 

The honors sequence differs from Math 32A/B in that it explores the topics of multivariable calculus with more mathematical rigor.  In particular, in this course, you will explore not just the geometric meaning behind these definitions and theorems, but you will also learn why these definitions and theorems are true.  I also plan to help you develop the reasoning and questioning skills needed to explore these mathematical ideas.  Some questions you might see include the following:

\begin{motivating}
What changes, and what stays the same when we move from single variable calculus to multivariable calculus?  What does it mean to take a derivative of a multivariable function?
\end{motivating}


Moreover, this course builds the foundation for more advanced topics in mathematics, such as linear algebra, real analysis, complex analysis, and differential geometry.  This course is recommended for students interested in learning about advanced mathematics.

These lecture notes are intended to supplement the course lecture slides, and they will provide a mix of both computational and proof-based questions.  They draw on material from the following texts:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textit{Calculus and Analysis in Euclidean Space,} by Shurman.
    \item \textit{Vector Calculus, Linear Algebra, and Differential Forms: A Unified Approach}, by Hubbard and Hubbard.
    \item \textit{Multivariable Calculus}, by Rogawski and Adams.
\end{itemize}

You might find it convenient to obtain copies of these books for reference.
